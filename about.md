I'm an engineer at [Uber's Advanced Technologies Group][atg] in San Francisco and AI Resident at [Uber AI Labs][uber-ai]. I'm building high fidelity, realistic simulators for self driving cars by leveraging modern advances in machine learning.

More broadly, I'm interested in machine learning and its applications to machine perception, language understanding, knowledge representation and robotics.

Georgia Tech grad with concentration areas in AI and Systems. Currently working on self driving technology at Uber's Advanced Technologies Group.

I studied computer science at Georgia Tech with focus areas in [AI][ai-gatech] and [Systems][systems-gatech]. I've spent summers at [Google][google], [Facebook][facebook] and [Qualcomm][qualcomm].
