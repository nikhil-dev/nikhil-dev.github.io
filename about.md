I'm an engineer at [Uber's Advanced Technologies Group][atg] in San Francisco and AI Resident at [Uber AI Labs][uber-ai]. I'm building high fidelity, realistic simulators for self driving cars by leveraging modern advances in machine learning.

More broadly, I'm interested in machine learning and its applications to machine perception, language understanding, knowledge representation and robotics.

Georgia Tech grad with concentration areas in AI and Systems. Currently working on self driving technology at Uber's Advanced Technologies Group.



I'm an engineer at [Uber Advanced Technologies Center][uatc] in Pittsburgh, where we work on [self driving technology][uatc-work]. I'm a deep believer in the potential of technology to move us forward, specifically its potential as an equalizer and to improve the quality of our lives.

I'm especially interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, distributed systems, operating systems, human computer interfaces, interoperability of standards and the web. Prior to joining Uber ATC, I studied computer science at Georgia Tech. During my time there I focused on [Artificial Intelligence][ai-gatech] and [Systems][systems-gatech]. I've spent summers at [Google][google], [Facebook][facebook] and [Qualcomm][qualcomm].
