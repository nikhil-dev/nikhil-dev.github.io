I'm an engineer at [Uber Advanced Technologies Center][uatc] in Pittsburgh, where we work on [vehicle autonomy, safety and mapping][uatc-work]. I'm a deep believer in the potential of technology to move us forward, specifically its potential as an equalizer and to improve the quality of our lives.

My interests are in artificial intelligence, distributed systems, operating systems, human computer interfaces, interoperability of standards and the web. Prior to joining Uber ATC, I studied computer science at Georgia Tech. During my time there I focused on [Artificial Intelligence][ai-gatech] and [Systems][systems-gatech]. I've spent summers at [Google][google], [Facebook][facebook] and [Qualcomm][qualcomm].
